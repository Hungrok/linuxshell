# arch-chroot is a shell script that prepares a new "root directory" 
# with the necessary system mounts (/proc, /sys, /dev, etc.) and files (/etc/resolv.conf), 
# then does an unshare'd chroot into it. 
# You'll therefore be left with a chroot environment that's detached from both the main filesystem and process tree.


# dd of=1804rootfs.img bs=1 seek=32G count=0   
truncate 1804rootfs.img -s 32G    # create 32G raw block image , use this instead of dd 
mkfs.ext4 -F 1804rootfs.img
mkdir arm-chroot 
mount archlinuxarm.img arm-chroot
# download rootfs from cdimage.ubunt 
tar -xf XXX.tar.gz -C arm-chroot

apt install qemu-user-static 
cp /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static arm-chroot/usr/bin

# With qemu in play, arch-chroot from arch-install-scripts doesn't care and does all the special mounts you need.
